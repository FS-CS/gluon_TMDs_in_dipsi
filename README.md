# gluon_TMDs_in_dipsi: Computing observables for the study of the gluon TMDs inside the proton via quarkonium-pair production at the LHC

These codes were used to obtain the results presented in the following articles:
* [Studies of gluon TMDs and their evolution using quarkonium-pair production at the LHC](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-7619-1)
* [Pinning down the linearly-polarised gluons inside unpolarised protons using quarkonium-pair production at the LHC](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2018.08.004)

## Contents

The [fortran](./fortran) directory contains the FORTRAN code used to compute azimuthal asymmetries in quarkonium-pair production via gluon fusion within the TMD framework with TMD evolution.

The [mathematica](./mathematica) directory contains Mathematica notebooks used to fit the transverse-momentum spectrum of J/psi-pair production to the corresponding 13 TeV LHCb data, as well as notebooks used to explore the evolution formalism and how it affects the TMD observables.
